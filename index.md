I'm studying Software Development in Haaga-Helia ammattikorkeakoulu, Helsinki, Finland. 
I'm interested in lean-development, react.js, react native, RESTful software development, internet of things and 3D modeling and printing.
I will post on this website some projects
I'm working on as simple tutorials as well.
